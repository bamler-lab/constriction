        "# Tutorial: Compressing Natural Language With an Autoregressive Machine Learning Model and `constriction`\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Author:** Robert Bamler, University of Tuebingen\n",
        "- **Initial Publication Date:** Jan 7, 2022\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an interactive jupyter notebook.\n",
        "You can read this notebook [online](https://github.com/bamler-lab/constriction/blob/main/examples/python/03-tutorial-autoregressive-nlp-compression.ipynb) but if you want to execute any code, we recommend to [download](https://github.com/bamler-lab/constriction/raw/main/examples/python/03-tutorial-autoregressive-nlp-compression.ipynb) it.\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook teaches you how to losslessly compress and decompress data with `constriction` using an autoregressive machine learning model.\n",
        "We will use the simple character based recurrent neural network toy-model for natural language from the [Practical PyTorch Series](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/char-rnn-generation/char-rnn-generation.ipynb).\n",
        "You won't need any fancy hardware (like a GPU) to go along with this tutorial since the model is so simplistic that it can be trained on a normal consumer PC in about 30 minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The compression method we develop in this tutorial is for demonstration purpose only and not meant as a proposal for practical text compression.\n",
        "While you will find that our method can compress text that is similar to the training data very well (with a 40% reduction in bitrate compared to `bzip2`), you'll also find that it will generalize poorly to other text forms and that compression and decompression are excruciatingly slow.\n",
        "The poor generalization performance is not a fundamental issue of the presented approach; it is just a result of using a very simplistic model combined with a very small training set.\n",
        "The runtime performance, too, would improve to *some* degree if we used a better suited model and if we ported the implementation to a compiled language and avoid permanent data-copying between Python, PyTorch, and `constriction`.\n",
        "However, even so, autoregressive models tend to be quite runtime-inefficient in general due to poor parallelizability.\n",
        "An alternative to autoregressive models for exploiting correlations in data compression is the so-called bits-back technique.\n",
        "An example of bits-back coding with `constriction` is provided in [this problem set](https://robamler.github.io/teaching/compress22/problem-set-07.zip) (with [solutions](https://robamler.github.io/teaching/compress21/problem-set-07-solutions.zip))."

        "\n",
        "- The *encoder* reads the message that we want to compress character by character and updates the autoregressive model with each step.\n",
        "  It uses the output of the model at each step to define an entropy model for encoding the next character.\n",
        "- The *decoder* decodes one character at a time and uses it to perform the exact same model updates as the encoder did.\n",
        "  The entropy model used for each decoding step is defined by the model output from the previous step.\n",
        "\n",
        "The very first model update on both encoder and decoder side is a bit subtle because we don't yet have a \"previous\" character to provide as input for the model update here.\n",
        "We'll just make up a fake character that we pretend exists before the start of the actual message, and we'll inject this fake character at the very beginning to both the encoder and the decoder.\n",
        "Let's use the newline character `\"\\n\"` for this purpose since this seems like a character that could indeed naturally precede the beginning of any message.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since encoding and decoding iterate over the characters in the same order, we'll need to use an entropy coder with *queue* semantics (i.e., \"first in first out\").\n",
        "The `constriction` library provides two entropy coders with queue semantics: [Range Coding](https://bamler-lab.github.io/constriction/apidoc/python/stream/queue.html) and [Huffman Coding](https://bamler-lab.github.io/constriction/apidoc/python/symbol.html).\n",

        "### How to Implement Iterative Model Updates\n",
        "\n",
        "So how are we going to perform these iterative model updates described above in practice?\n",
        "Let's just start from how it's done in the the implementation of the model (which you cloned into the subdirectory `char-rnn.pytorch` in Step 3 above) and adapt it to our needs.\n",
        "The file `generate.py` seems like a good place to look for inspiration since generating random text from the model is not all that different from what we're trying to do: both have to update the model character by character, continuously obtaining a probability distribution over the next character.\n",
        "The only difference is that `generate.py` uses the obtained probability distribution to sample from it while we'll use it to define an entropy model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function `generate` in `char-rnn.pytorch/generate.py` shows us how to do all the steps we need.\n",
        "The function takes a model as argument, which is—confusingly—called `decoder`.\n",
        "The function body starts by initializing a hidden state as follows,\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "    hidden = decoder.init_hidden(1)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "After some more initializations, the function enters a loop that iteratively updates the model as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "    output, hidden = decoder(inp, hidden)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "where `inp` is the \"input\", i.e., the previous character, represented (for technical reasons) as an integer PyTorch tensor of length `1`.\n",
        "The above model update returns `output` and the updated `hidden` state.\n",
        "On the next line of code, `output` gets scaled by some temperature and exponentiated before it is interpreted as an (unnormalized) probability distribution by being passed into `torch.multinomial`.\n",
        "Thus, `output` seems to be a tensor of logits, defining the probability distribution for the next character.\n",
        "Finally, after drawing a sample `top_i` from the `torch.multinomial` distribution, the function maps the sampled integer to a character as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "    predicted_char = all_characters[top_i]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, there seems to be some fixed string `all_characters` that has the character with integer representation `i` at its `i`'th position.\n",
