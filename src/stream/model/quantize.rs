/// # Detailed Description
///
/// A `LeakyQuantizer` is a builder of [`LeakilyQuantizedDistribution`]s. It takes an
/// arbitrary probability distribution that implements the [`Distribution`] trait from the
/// crate [`probability`] and turns it into a [`LeakilyQuantizedDistribution`] by performing
/// the following three steps:
///
/// 1. **quantization**: lossless entropy coding can only be performed over *discrete* data.
///    Any continuous (real-valued) data has to be approximated by some discrete set of
///    points. If you provide a continuous distributions (i.e., a probability density
///    function) to this builder, then it will quantize the data space by rounding values to
///    the nearest integer. This step is optional, see
///    [below](#continuous-vs-discrete-probability-distributions).
/// 2. **approximation with fixed-point arithmetic**: an entropy model that is used for
///    compressing and decompressing has to be *exactly* invertible, so that its
///    [`EncoderModel`] implementation is compatible with its [`DecoderModel`]
///    implementation. The `LeakilyQuantizedDistribution`s that are built by this builder
///    represent probabilities and quantiles in fixed-point arithmetic with `PRECISION`
///    bits. This allows them to avoid rounding errors when inverting the model, so that
///    they can implement both `EncoderModel` and `DecoderModel` in such a way that one is
///    the *exact* inverse of the other.
/// 3. **introducing leakiness**: naively approximating a probability distribution with
///    fixed point arithmetic could lead to problems: it could round some very small
///    probabilities to zero. This would have the undesirable effect that the corresponding
///    symbol then could no longer be encoded. This builder ensures that the
///    `LeakilyQuantizedDistribution`s that it creates assign a nonzero probability to all
///    symbols within a user-defined range, so that these symbols can always be encoded,
///    even if their probabilities under the *original* probability distribution are very
///    low (or even zero).
///
/// # Continuous vs. Discrete Probability Distributions
///
/// The method [`quantize`] accepts both continuous probability distributions (i.e.,
/// probability density functions, such as [`Gaussian`]) and discrete distributions that are
/// defined only on (some) integers (i.e., probability mass functions, such as
/// [`Binomial`]). The resulting [`LeakilyQuantizedDistribution`] will always be a discrete
/// probability distribution. If the original probability distribution is continuous, then
/// the quantizer implicitly creates bins of size one by rounding to the nearest integer
/// (i.e., the bins range from `i - 0.5` to `i + 0.5` for each integer `i`). If the original
/// probability distribution is discrete then no rounding in the symbol space occurs, but
/// the quantizer still performs steps 2 and 3 above, i.e., it still rounds probabilities
/// and quantiles to fixed-point arithmetic in a way that ensures that all probabilities
/// within a user-defined range are nonzero.
///
/// ## Don't Quantize *Categorical* Distributions, Though.
///
/// Although you can use a `LeakyQuantizer` for *discrete* probability distributions, you
/// should *not* use it for probability distributions of the type
/// [`probability::distribution::Categorical`]. While this will technically work, it will
/// lead to poor computational performance (and also to *slightly* suboptimal compression
/// efficiency). If you're dealing with categorical distributions, use one of the dedicated
/// types [`ContiguousCategoricalEntropyModel`], [`NonContiguousCategoricalEncoderModel`],
/// [`NonContiguousCategoricalDecoderModel`], or [`ContiguousLookupDecoderModel`] or
/// [`NonContiguousLookupDecoderModel`] instead.
///
/// By contrast, *do* use a `LeakyQuantizer` if the underlying probability [`Distribution`]
/// can be described by some analytic function (e.g., the function `f(x) ‚àù e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2}`
/// describing the bell curve of a Gaussian distribution, or the function `f_n(k) = (n
/// choose k) p^k (1-p)^{n-k}` describing the probability mass function of a binomial
/// distribution). For such parameterized distributions, both the cumulative distribution
/// function and its inverse can often be expressed as, or at least approximated by, some
/// analytic expression that can be evaluated in constant time, independent of the number of
/// possible symbols.
///
/// # Computational Efficiency
///
/// Two things should be noted about computational efficiency:
///
/// - **quantization is lazy:** both the constructor of a `LeakyQuantizer` and the method
///   [`quantize`] perform only a small constant amount of work, independent of the
///   `PRECISION` and the number of symbols on which the resulting entropy model will be
///   defined. The actual quantization is done once the resulting
///   [`LeakilyQuantizedDistribution`] is used for encoding and/or decoding, and it is only
///   done for the involved symbols.
/// - **quantization for decoding is more expensive than for encoding:** using a
///   `LeakilyQuantizedDistribution` as an [`EncoderModel`] only requires evaluating the
///   cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the underlying continuous probability
///   distribution a constant number of times (twice, to be precise). By contrast, using it
///   as a [`DecoderModel`] requires numerical inversion of the cumulative distribution
///   function. This numerical inversion starts by calling [`Inverse::inverse`] from the
///   crate [`probability`] on the underlying continuous probability distribution. But the
///   result of this method call then has to be refined by repeatedly probing the CDF in
///   order to deal with inevitable rounding errors in the implementation of
///   `Inverse::inverse`. The number of required iterations will depend on how accurate the
///   implementation of `Inverse::inverse` is.
///
/// The laziness means that it is relatively cheap to use a different
/// `LeakilyQuantizedDistribution` for each symbol of the message, which is a common
/// thing to do in machine-learning based compression methods. By contrast, if you want to
/// use the *same* entropy model for many symbols then a `LeakilyQuantizedDistribution` can
/// become unnecessarily expensive, especially for decoding, because you might end up
/// calculating the inverse CDF in the same region over and over again. If this is the case,
/// consider tabularizing the `LeakilyQuantizedDistribution` that you obtain from the method
/// [`quantize`] by calling [`to_generic_encoder_model`] or [`to_generic_decoder_model`] on
/// it (or, if you use a low `PRECISION`, you may even consider calling
/// [`to_generic_lookup_decoder_model`]). You'll have to bring the trait
/// [`IterableEntropyModel`] into scope to call these conversion methods (`use
/// constriction::stream::model::IterableEntropyModel`).
///
/// # Requirements for Correctness
///
/// The original distribution that you pass to the method [`quantize`] can only be an
/// approximation of a true (normalized) probability distribution because it represents
/// probabilities with finite (floating point) precision. Despite the possibility of
/// rounding errors in the underlying (floating point) distribution, a `LeakyQuantizer` is
/// guaranteed to generate a valid entropy model with exactly compatible implementations of
/// [`EncoderModel`] and [`DecoderModel`] as long as both of the following requirements are
/// met:
///
/// - The cumulative distribution function (CDF) [`Distribution::distribution`] is defined
///   on all mid points between integers that lie within the range that is provided as
///   argument `support` to the `new` method; it is monotonically nondecreasing, and its
///   values do not exceed the closed interval `[0.0, 1.0]`. It is OK if the CDF does not
///   cover the entire interval from `0.0` to `1.0` (e.g., due to rounding errors or
///   clipping); any remaining probability mass on the tails is added to the probability
///   of the symbols at the respective ends of the `support`.
/// - The quantile function or inverse CDF [`Inverse::inverse`] evaluates to a finite
///   non-NaN value everywhere on the open interval `(0.0, 1.0)`, and it is monotonically
///   nondecreasing on this interval. It does not have to be defined at the boundaries `0.0`
///   or `1.0` (more precisely, it only has to be defined on the closed interval
///   `[epsilon, 1.0 - epsilon]` where `epsilon := 2.0^{-(PRECISION+1)}` and `^` denotes
///   mathematical exponentiation). Further, the implementation of `Inverse::inverse` does
///   not actually have to be the inverse of `Distribution::distribution` because it is only
///   used as an initial hint where to start a search for the true inverse. It is OK if
///   `Inverse::inverse` is just some approximation of the true inverse CDF. Any deviations
///   between `Inverse::inverse` and the true inverse CDF will negatively impact runtime
///   performance but will otherwise have no observable effect.
