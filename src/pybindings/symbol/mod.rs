/// Symbol codes. Mainly provided for teaching purpose. You'll probably want to use a
/// [stream code](stream.html) instead.
///
/// Symbol codes encode messages (= sequences of symbols) by compressing each symbol
/// individually and then concatenating the compressed representations of the symbols
/// (called code words). This has the advantage of being conceptually simple, but the
/// disadvantage of incurring an overhead of up to almost 1 bit *per symbol*. The overhead
/// is most significant in the regime of low entropy per symbol (often the regime of novel
/// machine-learning based compression methods), since each (nontrivial) symbol in a symbol
/// code contributes at least 1 bit to the total bitrate of the message, even if its
/// information content is only marginally above zero.
///
/// This module defines the types `QueueEncoder`, `QueueDecoder`, and `StackCoder`, which
/// are essentially just efficient containers for of growable bit strings. The interesting
/// part happens in the so-called code book, which defines how symbols map to code words. We
/// provide the Huffman Coding algorithm in the submodule [`huffman`](symbol/huffman.html),
/// which calculates an optimal code book for a given probability distribution.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// The following two examples both encode and then decode a sequence of symbols using the
/// same entropy model for each symbol. We could as well use a different entropy model for
/// each symbol, but it would make the examples more lengthy.
///
/// - Example 1: Encoding and decoding with "queue" semantics ("first in first out", i.e.,
///   we'll decode symbols in the same order in which we encode them):
///
/// ```python
/// import constriction
/// import numpy as np
///
/// # Define an entropy model over the (implied) alphabet {0, 1, 2, 3}:
/// probabils = np.array([0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1], dtype=np.float32)
///
/// # Encode some example message, using the same model for each symbol here:
/// message = [1, 3, 2, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1]
/// encoder = constriction.symbol.QueueEncoder()
/// encoder_codebook = constriction.symbol.huffman.EncoderHuffmanTree(probabils)
/// for symbol in message:
///     encoder.encode_symbol(symbol, encoder_codebook)
///
/// # Obtain the compressed representation and the bitrate:
/// compressed, bitrate = encoder.get_compressed()
/// print(compressed, bitrate) # (prints: [3756389791, 61358], 48)
/// print(f"(in binary: {[bin(word) for word in compressed]}")
///
/// # Decode the message
/// decoder = constriction.symbol.QueueDecoder(compressed)
/// decoded = []
/// decoder_codebook = constriction.symbol.huffman.DecoderHuffmanTree(probabils)
/// for symbol in range(19):
///     decoded.append(decoder.decode_symbol(decoder_codebook))
///
/// assert decoded == message # (verifies correctness)
/// ```
///
/// - Example 2: Encoding and decoding with "stack" semantics ("last in first out", i.e.,
///   we'll encode symbols from back to front and then decode them from front to back):
///
/// ```python
/// import constriction
/// import numpy as np
///
/// # Define an entropy model over the (implied) alphabet {0, 1, 2, 3}:
/// probabils = np.array([0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.1], dtype=np.float32)
///
/// # Encode some example message, using the same model for each symbol here:
/// message = [1, 3, 2, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1]
/// coder = constriction.symbol.StackCoder()
/// encoder_codebook = constriction.symbol.huffman.EncoderHuffmanTree(probabils)
/// for symbol in reversed(message): # Note: reversed
///     coder.encode_symbol(symbol, encoder_codebook)
///
/// # Obtain the compressed representation and the bitrate:
/// compressed, bitrate = coder.get_compressed()
/// print(compressed, bitrate) # (prints: [[2818274807, 129455] 48)
/// print(f"(in binary: {[bin(word) for word in compressed]}")
///
/// # Decode the message (we could explicitly construct a decoder:
/// # `decoder = constriction.symbol.StackCoder(compressed)`
/// # but we can also also reuse our existing `coder` for decoding):
/// decoded = []
/// decoder_codebook = constriction.symbol.huffman.DecoderHuffmanTree(probabils)
/// for symbol in range(19):
///     decoded.append(coder.decode_symbol(decoder_codebook))
///
