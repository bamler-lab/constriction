/// Codebooks for Huffman coding [1].
///
/// The Huffman algorithm constructs an optimal code book for a given categorical
/// probability distribution. Note however, that even an optimal code book is limited to
/// assigning an *integer* number of bits to each symbol, which results in an overhead of up
/// to 1 bit per symbol in the regime of low entropy per symbol. Stream codes, as provided
/// by the module [`constriction.stream`](../stream.html) remove most of this overhead by
/// amortizing compressed bits over several symbols.
///
/// Our implementation of Huffman trees uses the order in of provided symbols to break ties
/// if two subtrees have the same weight. Thus, reordering probabilities can affect the
/// shape of a Huffman tree in a nontrivial way in edge cases.

/// A container of compressed bits that allows appending and consuming bits from the same

///
/// When encoding onto a `StackCoder`, the bits that comprise each code word are
/// automatically appended in reverse order so that a prefix-free code becomes a suffix-free
/// code which can easily be decoded from the end. For Huffman Coding, this is actually the
/// natural way to generate code words (by walking the tree from a leaf to the root).
///
/// A `StackCoder` does not distinguish between an encoder and a decoder. It supports both
/// encoding and decoding with a single data structure and even allows you to arbitrarily
/// switch back and forth between encoding and decoding operations (e.g., for bits-back
/// coding).
///
/// The constructor takes existing compressed data as an optional argument. If it is
/// provided, it must must be a rank-1 numpy array with, as in the first return value of the
/// method `get_compressed`. If no argument is provided, then the `StackCoder` is
/// initialized empty (useful for encoding).
