/// Experimental entropy coding algorithm for advanced variants of bits-back coding.
///
/// This module provides the `ChainCoder`, an experimental entropy coder that is similar
/// to an [`AnsCoder`](stack.html#constriction.stream.stack.AnsCoder) in that it operates as
/// a stack (i.e., a last-in-first-out data structure). However, different to an `AnsCoder`,
/// a `ChainCoder` treats each symbol independently. Thus, when decoding some bit string
/// into a sequence of symbols, any modification to the entropy model for one symbol does
/// not affect decoding for any other symbol (by contrast, when decoding with an `AnsCoder`
/// or `RangeDecoder`, a change to the entropy model for one symbol can affect *all*
/// subsequently decoded symbols too, see [Motivation](#motivation) below).
///
/// Treating symbols independently upon encoding and decoding can be useful for advanced
/// compression methods that combine inference, quantization, and bits-back coding. In
/// treating symbols independently, a `ChainCoder` bears some resemblance with symbol codes.
/// However, in contrast to symbol codes, a `ChainCoder` still amortizes compressed bits
/// over symbols and therefore has better compression effectiveness than a symbol code; in a
/// sense, it just delays amortization to the very end of its life cycle (see "[How Does
/// `ChainCoder` Work?](#how-does-chaincoder-work)" below).
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// A `ChainCoder` is meant to be used as a building block for advanced applications of the
/// bits-back trick [1, 2]. One therefore typically starts on the encoder side by *decoding*
/// some "side information" into a sequence of symbols. On the decoder side, one then
/// recovers the side information by *(re-)encoding* these symbols. It is important to be
/// aware that both the initialization of a `ChainCoder` and the way how we obtain its
/// encapsulated data differ from the encoder and decoder side, as illustrated in the
/// following example of a full round trip:
///
/// ```python
/// # Parameters for a few example Gaussian entropy models:
/// leaky_gaussian = constriction.stream.model.QuantizedGaussian(-100, 100)
/// means = np.array([3.2, -14.3, 5.7])
/// stds = np.array([6.4, 4.2, 3.9])
///
/// def run_encoder_part(side_information):
///     # Construct a `ChainCoder` for *decoding*:
///     coder = constriction.stream.chain.ChainCoder(
///         side_information,    # Provided bit string.
///         is_remainders=False, # Bit string is *not* remaining data after decoding.
///         seal=True            # Bit string comes from an external source here.
///     )
///     # Decode side information into a sequence of symbols as usual in bits-back coding:
///     symbols = coder.decode(leaky_gaussian, means, stds)
///     # Obtain what's *remaining* on the coder after decoding the symbols:
///     remaining1, remaining2 = coder.get_remainders()
///     return symbols, np.concatenate([remaining1, remaining2])
///
/// def run_decoder_part(symbols, remaining):
///     # Construct a `ChainCoder` for *encoding*:
///     coder = constriction.stream.chain.ChainCoder(
///         remaining,           # Provided bit string.
///         is_remainders=True,  # Bit string *is* remaining data after decoding.
///         seal=False           # Bit string comes from a `ChainCoder`, no need to seal it.
///     )
///     # Re-encode the symbols to recover the side information:
///     coder.encode_reverse(symbols, leaky_gaussian, means, stds)
///     # Obtain the reconstructed data
///     data1, data2 = coder.get_data(unseal=True)
///     return np.concatenate([data1, data2])
///
/// np.random.seed(123)
/// sample_side_information = np.random.randint(2**32, size=10, dtype=np.uint32)
/// symbols, remaining = run_encoder_part(sample_side_information)
/// recovered = run_decoder_part(symbols, remaining)
/// assert np.all(recovered == sample_side_information)
/// ```
///
/// Notice that:
///
/// - we construct the `ChainCoder` with argument `is_remainders=False` on the encoder side
///   (which *decodes* symbols from the side information), and with argument
///   `is_remainders=True` on the decoder side (which *re-encodes* the symbols to recover the
///   side information); and
/// - we export the remaining bit string on the `ChainCoder` after decoding some symbols
///   from it by calling `get_remainders`, and we export the recovered side information after
///   re-encoding the symbols by calling `get_data`. Both methods return a pair of bit
///   strings (more precisely, `uint32` arrays) where only the second item of the pair is
///   strictly required to invert the process we just performed, but we may concatenate the
///   two bit strings without loss of information.
///
/// To understand why this asymmetry between encoder and decoder side is necessary, see
/// section "[How Does `ChainCoder` Work?](#how-does-chaincoder-work)" below.
///
/// [A side remark concerning the `seal` and `unseal` arguments: when constructing a
/// `ChainCoder` from some bit string that we obtained from either
/// `ChainCoder.get_remaining()` or from `AnsCoder.get_compressed()` then we may set
/// `seal=False` in the constructor since these methods guarantee that the last word of the
/// bit string is nonzero. By contrast, when we construct a `ChainCoder` from some bit
/// string that is outside of our control (and that may therefore end in a zero word), then
/// we have to set `seal=True` in the constructor (and we then have to set `unseal=True`
/// when we want to get that bit string back via `get_data`).]
///
/// ## Motivation
///
/// The following two examples illustrate how the `ChainCoder` provided in this module
/// differs from an `AnsCoder` from the sister module `constriction.stream.stack`.
///
/// ### The Problem With `AnsCoder`
///
/// We start with an `AnsCoder`, and we decode a fixed bitstring `data` two times, using
/// slightly different sequences of entropy models each time. As expected, decoding the same
/// data with different entropy models leads to different sequences of decoded symbols.
/// Somewhat surprisingly, however, changes to entropy models can have a ripple effect: in
/// the example below, the line marked with "<-- change first entropy model" changes *only*
/// the entropy model for the first symbol. Nevertheless, this change of a single entropy
/// model causes the coder to decode different symbols in more than just that one place.
///
/// ```python
/// # Some sample binary data and sample probabilities for our entropy models
/// data = np.array([0x80d14131, 0xdda97c6c, 0x5017a640, 0x01170a3e], np.uint32)
/// probabilities = np.array(
///     [[0.1, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1],  # (<-- probabilities for first decoded symbol)
///      [0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.5],  # (<-- probabilities for second decoded symbol)
///      [0.2, 0.1, 0.4, 0.3]]) # (<-- probabilities for third decoded symbol)
/// model_family = constriction.stream.model.Categorical(perfect=False)
///
/// # Decoding `data` with an `AnsCoder` results in the symbols `[0, 0, 2]`:
/// ansCoder = constriction.stream.stack.AnsCoder(data, seal=True)
/// print(ansCoder.decode(model_family, probabilities)) # (prints: [0, 0, 2])
///
/// # Even if we change only the first entropy model (slightly), *all* decoded
/// # symbols can change:
/// probabilities[0, :] = np.array([0.09, 0.71, 0.1, 0.1])
/// ansCoder = constriction.stream.stack.AnsCoder(data, seal=True)
/// print(ansCoder.decode(model_family, probabilities)) # (prints: [1, 0, 0])
/// ```
///
/// In the above example, it's no surprise that changing the first entropy model made the
/// first decoded symbol change (from "0" to "1"). But notice that the third symbol also
/// changes (from "1" to "3") even though we didn't change its entropy model. This ripple
/// effect is a result of the fact that the internal state of `ansCoder` after decoding the
/// first symbol depends on `model1`. This is usually what we'd want from a good entropy
/// coder that packs as much information into as few bits as possible. However, it can
/// become a problem in certain advanced compression methods that combine bits-back coding
/// with quantization and inference. For those applications, a `ChainCoder`, illustrated in
/// the next example, may be more suitable.
///
/// ### The Solution With a `ChainCoder`
///
/// In the following example, we replace the `AnsCoder` with a `ChainCoder`. This means,
/// firstly and somewhat trivially, that we will decode the same bit string `data` into a
/// different sequence of symbols than in the last example because `ChainCoder` uses a
/// different entropy coding algorithm than `AnsCoder`. The more profound difference to the
/// example with the `AnsCoder` above is, however, that changes to a single entropy model no
/// longer have a ripple effect: when we now change the entropy model for one of the
/// symbols, this change affects only the corresponding symbol. All subsequently decoded
/// symbols remain unchanged.
///
/// ```python
/// # Same compressed data and original entropy models as in our first example
/// data = np.array([0x80d14131, 0xdda97c6c, 0x5017a640, 0x01170a3e], np.uint32)
/// probabilities = np.array(
///     [[0.1, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1],  # (<-- probabilities for first decoded symbol)
///      [0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.5],  # (<-- probabilities for second decoded symbol)
///      [0.2, 0.1, 0.4, 0.3]]) # (<-- probabilities for third decoded symbol)
/// model_family = constriction.stream.model.Categorical(perfect=False)
///
/// # Decode with the original entropy models, this time using a `ChainCoder`:
/// chainCoder = constriction.stream.chain.ChainCoder(data, seal=True)
/// print(chainCoder.decode(model_family, probabilities)) # (prints: [0, 3, 3])
///
/// # We obtain different symbols than for the `AnsCoder`, of course, but that's
/// # not the point here. Now let's change the first model again:
/// probabilities[0, :] = np.array([0.09, 0.71, 0.1, 0.1])
/// chainCoder = constriction.stream.chain.ChainCoder(data, seal=True)
/// print(chainCoder.decode(model_family, probabilities)) # (prints: [1, 3, 3])
/// ```
///
/// Notice that the only symbol that changes is the one whose entropy model we changed.
/// Thus, in a `ChainCoder`, changes to entropy models (and also to compressed bits) only
/// have a *local* effect on the decompressed symbols.
///
/// ## How Does `ChainCoder` Work?
///
/// The class `ChainCoder` uses an experimental new entropy coding algorithm that is
/// inspired by but different to Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) [3] as used by the
/// `AnsCoder` in the sister module `constriction.stream.stack`. This experimental new
/// entropy coding algorithm was proposed in Ref. [4].
///
/// **In ANS**, decoding a single symbol can conceptually be divided into three steps:
///
/// 1. We chop off a *fixed integer* number of bits (the `AnsCoder` uses 24 bits by default)
///    from the end of the compressed bit string.
/// 2. We interpret the 24 bits obtained from Step 1 above as the fixed-point binary
///    representation of a fractional number between zero and one and we map this number to
///    a symbol via the quantile function of the entropy model (the quantile function is the
///    inverse of the cumulative distribution function; it is sometimes also called the
///    percent-point function).
/// 3. We put back some (typically non-integer amount of) information content to the
///    compressed bit string by using the bits-back trick [1, 2]. These "returned" bits
///    account for the difference between the 24 bits that we consumed in Step 1 above and
///    the true information content of the symbol that we decoded in Step 2 above.
///
/// The ripple effect from a single changed entropy model that we observed in the [ANS
/// example above](#the-problem-with-anscoder) comes from Step 3 of the ANS algorithm since
/// the information content that we put back (and therefore also the internal state of the
/// coder after putting back the information) depends on the employed entropy model. By
/// contrast, Step 1 is independent of the entropy model and Step 2 does not mutate the
/// coder's internal state. To avoid a ripple effect when changing entropy models, a
/// `ChainCoder` therefore effectively postpones Step 3 to a later point.
///
/// In detail, a `ChainCoder` keeps track of not just one but two bit strings, which we
/// call `compressed` and `remaining`. When we use a `ChainCoder` to *decode* a symbol then
/// we chop off 24 bits from `compressed` (analogous to Step 1 of the above ANS algorithm)
/// and we identify the decoded symbol (Step 2); different to Step 3 of the ANS algorithm,
/// however, we then put back the variable-length superfluous  information to the *separate*
/// bit string `remaining`. Thus, if we were to change the entropy model, this change can
/// only affect the decoded symbol and the contents of `remaining` after decoding the
/// symbol, but it will not affect the contents of `compressed` after decoding the symbol.
/// Thus, any subsequent symbols that we decode from the bit string `compressed` remain
/// unaffected.
///
/// If we want to use a `ChainCoder` to *encode* data then we have to initialize `remaining`
/// with some sufficiently long bit string (by setting `is_remaining=True` in the
/// constructor, see [usage example](#usage-example). The methods `get_remaining` and
/// `get_data` return both bit strings `compressed` and `remaining` in the appropriate order
/// and with an appropriate finishing that allows the caller to concatenate them without a
/// delimiter (see again [usage example](#usage-example)).
///
/// ## Etymology
///
/// The name `ChainCoder` refers to the fact that the coder consumes and generates
/// compressed bits in fixed-sized quanta (24 bits per symbol by default), reminiscent of
/// how a chain (as opposed to, say, a rope) can only be shortened or extended by
/// fixed-sized quanta (the chain links).
