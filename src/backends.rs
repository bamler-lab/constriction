//! Sources and sinks of compressed data
//!
//! This module declares traits for reading and writing sequences of bits in small chunks
//! ("words") of fixed size. When entropy coders provided by `constriction` read in or write
//! out a word of compressed data they do this through a generic type, typically called
//! `Backend`, that implements one or more of the traits from this module. Declaring traits
//! for entropy coder backends allows us to make entropy coders generic over the specific
//! backends they use used rather than forcing a single choice of backend implementation on
//! all users of a given entropy coder. This gives users with specialized needs fine grained
//! control over the behaviour of entropy coders without sacrificing ergonomics or
//! computational efficiency in the common use cases.
//!
//! # This module is meant for advanced use cases
//!
//! Most users of `constriction` don't have to worry much about backends since all entropy
//! coders default (at compile time) to reasonable backends based on what you use them for.
//! You will usually end up using a `Vec` backend for encoding, and you may use either a
//! `Vec` or a [`Cursor`] backend for decoding depending on whether your entropyc coder has
//! stack or queue semantics and whether you want to consume or retain the compressed data
//! after decoding. However, these automatically inferred default backends may not be
//! suitable for certain advanced use cases. For example, you may want to decode data
//! directly from a network socket, or you may be implementing a container format that
//! performs some additional operation like multiplexing directly after entropy coding. In
//! such a case, you may want to declare your own type for the source or sink of compressed
//! data and implement the relevant traits from this module for it so that you can use it as
//! a backend for an entropy coder.
//!
//! # Module Overview
//!
//! The main traits in this module are [`ReadWords`] and [`WriteWords`]. They express the
//! capability of a backend to be a source and/or sink of compressed data, respectively.
//! Both traits are generic over a type `Word`, which is usually a [`BitArray`], and which
//! represents the smallest unit of compressed data that an entropy coder will read and/or
//! write at a time (all provided entropy coders in `constriction` are generic over the
//! `Word` and default to `Word = u32`). Types that implement one of the backend traits
//! often also implement [`Pos`] and/or [`Seek`] from the parent module. The remaining
//! traits in this module specify further properties of the backend (see
//! [`BoundedReadWords`] and [`BoundedWriteWords`]) and provide permanent or temporary
//! conversions into backends with different capabilities (see [`IntoReadWords`],
//! [`IntoSeekReadWords`], [`AsReadWords`], and [`AsSeekReadWords`]).
//!
//! The backend traits are implemented for the standard library type `Vec` where applicable
//! and for a few new types defined in this module. The most important type defined in this
//! module is a [`Cursor`], which wraps a generic buffer of an in-memory slice of words
//! together with an index into the buffer (`constriction::backends::Cursor` is to the
//! backend traits roughly what [`std::io::Cursor`] is to the `std::io::{Read, Write}`
//! traits). A [`Cursor`] can hold either owned or borrowed data and can be used for reading
//! and/or writing (if the buffer is mutable) with both [`Queue`] and [`Stack`] read/write
//! semantics.
//!
//! # Read/Write Semantics
//!
//! The [`ReadWords`] trait has a second type parameter with trait bound [`Semantics`].
//! `Semantics` are (typically zero sized) marker types that indicate how reads from a
//! backend behave in relation to writes to the backend. This issue is moot for backends
//! that support only one of reading or writing but not both. Therefore, any backend that
//! does not implement `WriteWords` may implement `ReadWords` for multiple `Semantics`.
//! However, backends that implement both `ReadWords` and `WriteWords` must make sure to
//! implement `ReadWords` only for the one or more appropriate semantics. There are two
//! predefined `Semantics`: [`Queue`], which indicates that reads and writes operate in the
//! same linear direction ("first in first out") and [`Stack`], which is also a linear
//! sequence of words but one where reads and writes operate in opposite directions ("last
//! in first out"). You may define your own `Semantics` if you want to implement a backend
//! based on a more fancy abstract data type.
//!
//! For example, we implement `WriteWords<Word>` and `ReadWords<Word, Stack>` but not
//! `ReadWords<Word, Queue>` for the type `Vec<Word>` from the standard library because
//! [`Vec::push`] and [`Vec::pop`] have `Stack` semantics. By contrast, the type [`Cursor`]
//! declared in this module, which wraps a memory buffer and an index into the buffer,
//! implements `ReadWords` for both `Stack` and `Queue` semantics. The `Queue`
//! implementation increases the index after reading and the `Stack` implementation
//! decreases the index before reading (if you want the opposite interpretation then you can
//! wrap the `Cursor` in a [`Reverse`]). Thus, a `Cursor` can be used by entropy coders
//! with both stack and queue semantics, and both can use the `Cursor` in the way that is
//! correct for them. By contrast, while a stack-based entropy coder (like [`AnsCoder`]) can
//! use a `Vec<Word>` for both encoding and decoding, an entropy coder with queue semantics
//! (like a Range Coder) can use a `Vec` only for encoding but it has to wrap the `Vec` in a
//! `Cursor` for decoding, thus preventing accidental misuse.
//!
//! # Example of Entropy Coding With a Non-Standard Backend
//!
//! The following example encodes and decodes data to and from a file. It uses custom
//! backends that directly write each `Word` to, and read each `Word` from the file. This is
//! not a very practical exampleâ€”if you encode all data at once then it's simpler and
//! possibly even more efficient to use the default backend, which writes to an in-memory
//! buffer, call `.get_compressed()` when you're done, and then flush the buffer to the file
//! in one go. But custom backends similar to the ones used in this example could also be
//! used to add additional processing to the compressed data, such as multiplexing or
//! demultiplexing for some container format.

// ADAPTER FOR (SEMANTIC) REVERSING OF READING DIRECTION ======================

/// Wrapper that inverts the read/write directions of a data source and/or data sink.
///
/// # Motivation
///
/// This wrapper is usually used for a [`Cursor`]. The `Cursor` type implements
/// `ReadWords<Word, S>` for both semantics `S = Queue` and `S = Stack`, so you can read
/// `Word`s from a cursor in either forward or backward direction.
///
/// Reading from a `Cursor` with `Queue` semantics reads from the underlying slice `[Word]`
/// in the normal direction (from index `0` to index `.len() - 1`), which is useful for
/// decoding data from an entropy coder that has queue semantics (like [`RangeEncoder`]). By
/// contrast, reading from a `Cursor` with `Stack` semantics reads in the reverse direction.
/// This is usually a good thing: it is consistent with how `Vec<Word>` (necessarily)
/// implements reading with `Stack` semantics, so if you have a `Vec<Word>` of data that was
/// compressed with a stack entropy coder (like [`AnsCoder`]) then you are free to choose
/// whether you want to decode the data either directly from the `Vec` or from a `Cursor`
/// that wraps the `Vec` (if you don't want to consume the compressed data). Both approaches
/// will achieve the same result, as you can see in the following example:
///
/// ```
/// use constriction::{
///     backends::Cursor, stream::{model::DefaultLeakyQuantizer, stack::DefaultAnsCoder, Decode},
///     UnwrapInfallible,
/// };
///
/// // Some simple entropy model, just for demonstration purpose.
/// let quantizer = DefaultLeakyQuantizer::new(-100..=100);
/// let model = quantizer.quantize(probability::distribution::Gaussian::new(25.0, 10.0));
///
/// // Encode the symbols `0..50` using a stack entropy coder and get the compressed data.
/// let mut coder = DefaultAnsCoder::new();
/// coder.encode_iid_symbols_reverse(0..50, &model).unwrap();
/// # // Test the claims we make in the comments below, but don't document them since that
/// # // would distract from the point we're trying to make here.
/// # let mut d = coder.as_decoder();
/// # assert!(d.decode_iid_symbols(50, &model).map(UnwrapInfallible::unwrap_infallible).eq(0..50));
/// # let mut d = coder.clone().into_decoder();
/// # assert!(d.decode_iid_symbols(50, &model).map(UnwrapInfallible::unwrap_infallible).eq(0..50));
/// let compressed = coder.into_compressed().unwrap_infallible(); // `compressed` is a `Vec<u32>`.
/// dbg!(compressed.len()); // Prints "compressed.len() = 11".
///
/// // You can either decode directly from the `Vec` (could also just have used `coder` for that).
/// let mut c2 = DefaultAnsCoder::from_compressed(compressed.clone()).unwrap();
/// assert!(c2.decode_iid_symbols(50, &model).map(UnwrapInfallible::unwrap_infallible).eq(0..50));
/// # assert!(c2.is_empty());
///
/// // Or you can wrap the slice `[u32]` in a `Cursor` (could have used `coder.as_decoder()`).
/// let borrowing_cursor = Cursor::new_at_write_end(&compressed[..]);
/// let mut c3 = DefaultAnsCoder::from_compressed(borrowing_cursor).unwrap();
/// assert!(c3.decode_iid_symbols(50, &model).map(UnwrapInfallible::unwrap_infallible).eq(0..50));
/// # assert!(c3.is_empty());
///
/// // You can also wrap the `Vec<u32>` in a `Cursor` (could have used `coder.into_decoder()`).
/// let owning_cursor = Cursor::new_at_write_end(compressed);
/// let mut c4 = DefaultAnsCoder::from_compressed(owning_cursor).unwrap();
/// assert!(c4.decode_iid_symbols(50, &model).map(UnwrapInfallible::unwrap_infallible).eq(0..50));
/// # assert!(c4.is_empty());
/// ```
///
/// However, it can sometimes be awkward to read data in reverse direction, e.g., if you're
/// reading it from a file or socket. In these situations you may prefer to reverse the
/// entire sequence of `Word`s after encoding so that the decoder can read them in forward
/// direction. You can then still wrap the reversed sequence of `Words` in a `Cursor`, but
/// if you pass this cursor to an `AnsCoder` then the `AnsCoder` has to know somehow that
/// the top of this stack is at the beginning of the slice, i.e., that reading with `Stack`
/// semantics means reading in the forward direction. To express this, wrap the `Cursor` in
/// a `Reverse`, otherwise you'll get garbled data:
///
/// ```
/// # use constriction::{
/// #     backends::Cursor, stream::{model::DefaultLeakyQuantizer, stack::DefaultAnsCoder, Decode},

/// # let mut compressed = coder.into_compressed().unwrap_infallible(); // `compressed` is a `Vec<u32>`.
/// use constriction::backends::Reverse;
///
/// // ... obtain same `model` and `compressed` as in the above example ...
///
/// compressed.reverse(); // Reverses the sequence of `u32` words in place (mutates `compressed`).
///
/// // Naively decoding the reversed compressed data leads to garbled symbols.
/// let wrong_cursor = Cursor::new_at_write_end(&compressed[..]);
/// let mut c5 = DefaultAnsCoder::from_compressed(wrong_cursor).unwrap();
/// let bug = c5.decode_iid_symbols(50, &model).collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>().unwrap_infallible();
/// dbg!(bug); // Prints "bug = [39, 47, 40, ...]", not what we had encoded.
///
/// // We must set the initial cursor position "at_write_beginning" and wrap it in a `Reverse`.
/// let reversed_cursor = Reverse(Cursor::new_at_write_beginning(&compressed[..]));
/// let mut c6 = DefaultAnsCoder::from_compressed(reversed_cursor).unwrap();
/// assert!(c6.decode_iid_symbols(50, &model).map(UnwrapInfallible::unwrap_infallible).eq(0..50));
/// # assert!(c6.is_empty());
/// ```
///
/// Wrapping a `Cursor` (or any `ReadWords`) in a `Reverse` with the statement `let
/// reversed_cursor = Reverse(original_cursor);` is a no-op. It changes neither the order of
/// the underlying sequence of `Word`s nor the current cursor position, but it will reverse
/// the direction in which the cursor position moves when you read data from
/// `reversed_cursor`. Therefore you should already have reversed the the underlying
/// sequence of `Word`s before you wrap the cursor in `Reverse`, and you should have
/// initialitze the `Cursor` position at the beginning of the reversed sequence of `Word`s
/// rather than the end.
///
/// # Shortcut
///
/// The method [`Cursor::into_reversed`] does everything at once:
/// - it reverses the underlying sequence of `Word`s;
/// - it moves the current read position to its mirrored position (thus following where the
///   value that it originally pointed to moved upon reversing the sequence of `Word`s); and
/// - it wraps the thus modified `Cursor` in a `Reverse`.

// ADAPTER FOR IN-MEMORY BUFFERS ==============================================

/// Adapter that turns an in-memory buffer into an `impl ReadWords` and/or an `impl
/// WriteWords`.
///
/// A `Cursor<Word, Buf>` allows you to use an in-memory buffer `Buf` of a slice of `Word`s
/// as a source and/or sink of compressed data in an entropy coder. The type `Buf` must
/// implement `AsRef<[Word]>` to be used as a data source (i.e., an implementation of
/// [`ReadWords`]) and it must implement `AsMut<[Word]>` to be used as a data sink (i.e., an
/// implementation of [`WriteWords`]). In the most typical use cases, `Buf` is either a
/// `Vec<Word>` (if the entropy coder should own the compressed data) or a reference to a
/// slice of `Word`s, i.e., `&[Word]` (if the entropy coder should only have shared access
/// to the compressed data, e.g., because you want to keep the compressed data alive even
/// after the entropy coder gets dropped).
///
/// A `Cursor<Word, Buf>` implements `ReadWords` for both [`Queue`] and [`Stack`] semantics.
/// By convention, reading with `Queue` semantics incremenets the `Cursor`'s index into the
/// slice returned by `.as_ref()` whereas reading with `Stack` semantics decrements the
/// index. Whether `Queue` or `Stack` semantics will be used is usually decided by the
/// implementation of the entropy coder that uses the `Cursor` as its backend. If you want
/// to read in the opposite direction than what's the convention for your use case (e.g.,
/// because you've already manually reversed the order of the `Word`s in the buffer) then
/// wrap the `Cursor` in a [`Reverse`]. The implementation of `WriteWords<Word>` (if `Buf`
/// implements `AsMut<[Word]>`) always writes in the same direction in which
/// `ReadWords<Word, Queue>` reads.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Sharing and Owning Cursors
///

/// use constriction::{

///         Encode, Decode
///     },
///     UnwrapInfallible,
/// };
///
/// // Some simple entropy model, just for demonstration purpose.
/// let quantizer = DefaultLeakyQuantizer::new(-100..=100);
/// let model = quantizer.quantize(probability::distribution::Gaussian::new(25.0, 10.0));
///
/// // Encode the symbols `0..100` using a `RangeEncoder` (uses the default `Vec` backend because

/// let mut encoder = DefaultRangeEncoder::new();
/// encoder.encode_iid_symbols(0..100, &model);
/// let compressed = encoder.into_compressed().unwrap_infallible(); // `compressed` is a `Vec<u32>`.
/// dbg!(compressed.len()); // Prints "compressed.len() = 40".
///
/// // Create a `RangeDecoder` with shared access to the compressed data. This constructs a
/// // `Cursor<u32, &[u32]>` that points to the beginning of the data and loads it in the decoder.
/// let mut sharing_decoder
///     = DefaultRangeDecoder::from_compressed(&compressed[..]).unwrap_infallible();
/// // `sharing_decoder` has type `RangeDecoder<u32, u64, Cursor<u32, &'a [u32]>`.
///
/// // Decode the data and verify correctness.
/// assert!(sharing_decoder.decode_iid_symbols(100, &model).map(Result::unwrap).eq(0..100));
/// assert!(sharing_decoder.maybe_exhausted());
///
/// // We can still use `compressed` because we gave the decoder only shared access to it. Thus,
/// // `sharing_decoder` contains a reference into `compressed`, so we couldn't return it from the
/// // current function. If we want to return a decoder, we have to give it ownership of the data:
/// let mut owning_decoder = DefaultRangeDecoder::from_compressed(compressed).unwrap_infallible();
/// // `owning_decoder` has type `RangeDecoder<u32, u64, Cursor<u32, Vec<u32>>`.

/// assert!(owning_decoder.decode_iid_symbols(100, &model).map(Result::unwrap).eq(0..100));
/// assert!(owning_decoder.maybe_exhausted());
/// ```
///
/// ## `Cursor`s automatically use the correct `Semantics`
///
/// You can use a `Cursor` also as a stack, e.g., for an [`AnsCoder`]. The `Cursor` will
/// automatically read data in the correct (i.e., reverse) direction when it is invoked with

/// decode with an `AnsCoder` because the `AnsCoder` can also decode directly from a `Vec`
/// (see last example below). However, you'll need a `Cursor` if you don't own the
/// compressed data:
///

/// (so you can interleave multiple encoding/decoding steps arbitrarily) whereas a `Cursor`
/// (whether it be sharing or owning) does not consume the compressed data that is read from
/// it. You can still interleave multiple encoding/decoding steps with an `AnsCoder` that
/// uses a `Cursor` instead of a `Vec` backend, but since a `Cursor` doesn't grow or shrink
/// the wrapped buffer you will typically either run out of buffer space at some point or
/// the final buffer will be padded to its original size with some partially overwritten
/// left-over compressed data (for older readers like myself: think of a `Cursor` as a
